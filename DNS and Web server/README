DNS and Web Server Integration Lab

Objective:
-------------
Demonstrate how DNS and Web servers work together to allow name-based access in a local network.

Topology:
-------------
[Router0] G0/0: 192.168.1.1
   |
[Switch0]
  |       \
[PC0]     [Server0]

Device Roles:
- Router0: Default gateway (192.168.1.1)
- Server0: DNS + HTTP Server (192.168.1.10)
- PC0: Client (192.168.1.20, uses DNS)

How It Works:
-------------
1. PC0 tries to access a web page using a domain name (e.g., www.company.local).
2. PC0 sends a DNS request to Server0.
3. Server0 resolves the hostname to the IP address 192.168.1.10.
4. PC0 then connects to Server0’s HTTP service using the resolved IP.
5. The web page hosted on Server0 is displayed in PC0’s browser.

Configuration Summary:
-------------
- Router0: IP 192.168.1.1 on G0/0
- Server0: IP 192.168.1.10, DNS + HTTP enabled
- PC0: IP 192.168.1.20, DNS server = 192.168.1.10

Server DNS Configuration:
- Domain name: www.company.local
- Mapped IP: 192.168.1.10

Testing Procedure:
-------------
1. On PC0, open the web browser and go to:
   http://www.company.local

2. From PC0 command prompt:
   > ping www.company.local
   > nslookup www.company.local

Expected Results:
-------------
- DNS resolves www.company.local → 192.168.1.10
- Ping succeeds
- Web page loads from Server0 showing the company welcome message

Verification:
-------------
- On Server0 → DNS → Records → verify A record
- On PC0 → check DNS settings and ping results
